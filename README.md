# C Small Projects

This repository contains a collection of small C projects developed as part of an engineering programming course. Each project is organized by topic and demonstrates various programming concepts and techniques in C.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into directories corresponding to different topics or assignments:

- **tema2/**: Projects related to Topic 2.
  - *coches_4.0/*: A car management system for adding, listing, editing, and deleting car records with persistent file storage.

- **tema3/**: Projects related to Topic 3.
  - *Text_Animation_Program/*: A program that animates a user-inputted text message by moving it across the console window. The user can configure the speed of the animation and the number of iterations.

- **tema4/**: Projects related to Topic 4.
  - *Message_Encryption_Program/*: A program that encrypts and decrypts messages using a specific algorithm.

- **tema5/**: How to work with binary and text files / streams.

- **tema6/**: Projects related to Topic 6.
  - *Binary_file_reader/*: A program that reads and processes binary files.

*Note: Replace placeholders with actual project names and descriptions as the repository evolves.*

## Getting Started

To explore and run these projects:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JesusFernandez86/C_small_projects.git
   cd C_small_projects
   ```

2. **Navigate to a specific project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd temaX/project_name
   ```

3. **Compile the project:**
   Use a C compiler like `gcc`:
   ```bash
   gcc -o project_executable source_file.c
   ```

4. **Run the executable:**
   ```bash
   ./project_executable
   ```

*Note: Replace `temaX/project_name`, `project_executable`, and `source_file.c` with the actual paths, executable names, and source files.*

## Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., `gcc`).
- Basic understanding of C programming.
